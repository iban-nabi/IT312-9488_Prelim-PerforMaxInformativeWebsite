                    surveys found that the traditional approaches to performance management do not effectively motivate
                    employees. This is because organizations have come to prioritize performance measurement over
                    development. While measurement still matters, it needs to be reframed and designed to support
                    development and performance improvement. There needs to be a philosophical and functional shift away
                    from performance management and into performance development.

                    2017) under Gallup, Inc., performance management has been re-engineered in order to structurally
                    reform and incorporate the finest practices of evidence-based management, starting with making
                    performance the subject of regular conversations that foster meaningful and successful
                    relationships.
                    <br>This framework embodies the shift from performance management to performance development via
                    three core principles: establish expectations, continually coach, and create accountability. When
                    performance becomes focused on these core principles, managers and employees can interact and form
                    discussions that are encouraging, purposeful, and rewarding, which helps employees with their own
                    performance, development, and career.

                            traditional
                            performance management is that it has managers using ratings and rankings that are often too
                            vague and
                            generalized (often using a simple 1-to-5 scale). They do not specify the actions, moments,
                            and results that define performance, and therefore not reflect what the manager expects from
                            each employee. It does not describe the impact or value that employees bring to the company,
                            which leaves them feeling defensive and unappreciated. Gallup describes 3 key criteria when

                                traditional performance management process. Performance reviews in general are far too

                                leaves managers struggling to recall all the details of an employee’s performance. This

                                employee’s negative behaviors within the past year. However, an employee’s behavior can
                                change on a
                                day-to-day basis and, depending on the demands at the time, may not be representative of

                                performance as a whole. Additionally, by the time feedback is shared during an annual

                                will be way too late to implement these changes into an employee’s behavior.

                                                focuses too narrowly on past mistakes and feels especially negative,

                            annual review). This recommendation stems from Gallup’s research finding that only less than
