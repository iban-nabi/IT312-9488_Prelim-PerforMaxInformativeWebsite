                    Performance management holds a big responsibility of having an effective business process because this system ensures
                    the employees performance values individually and even in collaboration with their team. It is considered a business
                    process because it affects the business continuity of the organization and its success (Ranjan, 2021). It is their
                    responsibility to ensure that individual goals lie within the organizational goals. There are several tools and models
                    invented that will help produce results of each employeeâ€™s performance that accommodates HR to assess their performance
                    and provide opportunities. <br><br>Project management involves having access to the statistical results of the employees' performances. 
                    Therefore, there are 5 elements of HR project management to have a successful start.

                <p class="article-description color-four font-regular">
                    This lies at the beginning of the project; it involves the initial plan of the HR, including the project's feasibility and identifying the goals to accomplish the project.

                    In this element, the workloads will be defined. The execution of the process will be discussed in this element, including creating the team, resources, and the environment. The division of work and budget planning are included in this element as well.

                    This part is where the progress will be monitored once it starts. There are strategies that can be utilized to maximize this step, including Earned Value Management, aka "EVM," which measures the performance and evaluates the progress of the project.

                    This step involves identifying the tasks that the team is working on to ensure that they are aligned with the scope and goals of the organization as well as the project itself. This will help the HR to evaluate the time each task takes.

                    It is the last step of a project's life cycle, where the project is formally completed, and all activities related to the project are concluded. In the context of HR projects, such as implementing a new HR system or conducting a company-wide training program, project closure involves wrapping up all the activities and evaluating the project's success.
