            <p class="article-author color-five font-regular">by majo majic</p>
            <p class="article-description font-regular">Have you ever caught yourself evaluating your quiz, exam, or presentation results and 
                then utilizing your evaluation as inspiration to perform better in your upcoming endeavors? If so, you have seen 
                the core benefit of employee performance management. 
                <br><br> Performance management may seem like the sole tool for evaluation, benefits or rewards, and promotion, but it is 
                more than that. It encompasses the motivation and effectiveness of employees and assists in the company's 
                decision-making and functional strategies. Here is a list of benefits that performance management can offer to companies:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="article-identifier color-two font-bold">Working on the same page</p>
            <p class="article-description font-regular">Working in a company can become confusing, especially when there are many roles to fill in. 
                With performance management, employees can identify their roles, give clarity to their goals, and better perform on their 
                deliverables. It can create a harmonious environment as employees and team leads work on the same page, understanding what 
                is expected from each other.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="article-identifier color-two font-bold">A Fuel for Motivation</p>
            <p class="article-description font-regular">Employees are prone to over-fatigue and can lose motivation most of the time. In order to 
                keep the company's performance going, companies try to find ways to motivate their employees. That's where performance 
                management kicks in. As mentioned in the previous point, performance management tools have the ability to provide clear 
                goals and roles for the employee, but the benefit continues beyond there. Employees can also gain motivation from 
                self-assessment and from rewards and recognition, which will be discussed in the following number.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="article-identifier color-two font-bold">Recognition, Rewards and Relationships</p>
            <p class="article-description font-regular">One factor that motivates employees is rewards and recognition because, honestly speaking, 
                who doesn’t want rewards? Performance management tools can act as a bridge for organizations and employees to boost 
                engagement and improve relationships through recognition and rewards. It can identify employees’ achievements and 
                recognize efforts that boosts motivation, improves productivity and promotes satisfaction. Lack of recognition can 
                result in not only lack of motivation but a high turnover rate.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="article-identifier color-two font-bold">Effective Planning and Decision Making</p>
            <p class="article-description font-regular">Team leads always have it hard. Aside from ensuring that business is moving, team leads 
                are also responsible for planning and distributing tasks to employees. And there are tendencies where errors occur, 
                most especially when leads do not know the employees well enough to recognize their strengths and weaknesses. 
                To avoid this kind of scenario, performance management tools can assist leads to place employees to better work 
                environments and responsibilities. Aside from that, performance management tools can also help team managers and 
                leads effectively see an employee's potential room for improvement, giving them a better view of how to assist them 
                through training, mentoring and seminars.</p>
